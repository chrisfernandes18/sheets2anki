# Sheets2Anki

**Sheets2Anki** is an Anki add-on that syncs your Anki decks with a Google Sheets document published as CSV. It supports both Basic and Cloze note types, automatically assigns tags, and removes cards that are no longer in Google Sheets.

## Features
- **Sync from Google Sheets (CSV):** Publish your Google Sheet as a CSV and easily integrate with Anki.
- **Supports Cloze and Basic Cards:** Automatically detect if a question is Cloze-formatted or a simple Q&A.
- **Automatic Tag Assignment:** Tags are derived from a specified column in your sheet.
- **Removes Deleted Cards:** If a card no longer appears in the Google Sheet, itâ€™s removed from Anki to maintain consistency.

## Installation
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/sebastianpaez/sheets2anki/releases) page of this repository.
2. Download the latest `.ankiaddon` file.
3. In Anki, go to `Tools > Add-ons > Install from file...`.
